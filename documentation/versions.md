# Versions

Laradocs comes with the ability to maintain and display multiple version of the documentation. This technique is used commonly when developing and deploying applications that have version numbers.

An example of this can be seen at [https://laravel.com/docs/5.3](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3)

If you wish to only have one version of your documentation online, Laradocs works in this use case as well.

## Creating a Version

Once you have logged into the administration side of Laradocs you will be presented with the **Documentation** screen. Here is where you can find the link to _Create Version_ which will allow you to create a new version of your documentation.

|Field|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Title|The title to display on the main website|5.4|
|Default Page|The default page that will be shown|Installation|
|Is Default|Is this the version that will be displayed initially?|Yes|
|Is Active|Is this version active?|Yes|
