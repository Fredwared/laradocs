# Importing

## From Github

Github requires that we use your username and an access token to access any repository that is found on their website.

### Creating an Access Token

On Github go into you `Settings` and find `Personal access tokens` in the navigation. Click `Generate new token` to proceed.

Fill in the description so that you will know what this token is for down the road and selected `Repo` so that it will have the following access

 * repo:status
 * repo_deployment
 * public_repo
